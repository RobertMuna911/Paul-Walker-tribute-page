        It's been a long day without you, my friend
        And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
        We've come a long way from where we began
        Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
        When I see you again
        
        [Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
        Damn, who knew?
        All the planes we flew, good things we been through
        That I'd be standing right here talking to you
        'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
        But something told me that it wouldn't last
        Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
        Those were the days, hard work forever pays
        Now I see you in a better place, uh
        
        [Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
        How can we not talk about family
        When family's all that we got?
        Everything I went through
        You were standing there by my side
        And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
        
        [Chorus: Charlie Puth]
        It's been a long day without you, my friend
        And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
        We've come a long way from where we began
        Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
        When I see you again
        
        [Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
        Aah oh, aah oh
        Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        Yeah
        
        [Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
        First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
        And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
        And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
        And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
        Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
        And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
        
        [Refrain: Wiz Khalifa]
        How can we not talk about family
        When family's all that we got?
        Everything I went through
        You were standing there by my side
        And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
        
        [Bridge: Charlie Puth]
        So let the light guide your way, yeah
        Hold every memory as you go
        And every road you take
        Will always lead you home, home
        
        [Chorus: Charlie Puth]
        It's been a long day without you, my friend
        And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
        We've come a long way from where we began
        Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
        When I see you again
        
        [Post-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
        Aah oh, aah oh
        Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
        Yeah
